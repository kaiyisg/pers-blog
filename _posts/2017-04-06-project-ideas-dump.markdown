Quick and dirty list of all the projects that I plan to embark on, and am currently in the process of brainstorming about.

### **Algorithmic trading**
Try to hack out the features of the stock market that I want to follow, and make trades based on that, and current market sentiments. I aim to employ ideas of dollar cost averaging while buying and selling stocks. Can use back trading to verify my algorithms

### **Scalable smart switches**
I plan to use the ESP8266 chip with a relay as an IoT node that can connect to the cloud, that can act as a smart switch.

### **Facial recognition for security**
I aim to do this running my own facial recognition neural network. I will use Android things so that I can run tensorflow easily.

### **Car price crawler**
Using the listed "fair" price on KBB, I plan to crawl latest car posts on craigslist to find out if there is an opportunity for arbitrage. Explore sites like â€‹https://superfeedr.com/ for this.

### **Bots on messenger**
Could be a telegram bot, use of AI / NLP to do some sementic stuff!

### **Backend in GO and GraphQL**
Just want to explore those technologies, could be on a RPI

### **Build my own server**
Set it up to use plex and vpn and sync my file system
