Having been in the valley for 2 months, I have seen a few points that differentiate singapore and the valley's innovation culture:

1. Focus on engineering (design thinking, etc) of gvt
2. Get patents and IPs and go out and found companies (pre req)
3. Need big VCs to come in to match passion and vision of all the tech people (back to 1, no focus (govt) and passion (people) in engineering)
4. Big question - is being lean more important, or having tech expertise? i think it is a culture thing?
5. Current CA of density of capital and talent
