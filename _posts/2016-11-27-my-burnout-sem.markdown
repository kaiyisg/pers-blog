Suffice to say that I had slightly more on my plate than I bargained for in my Y3S2, and getting through the semester was not easy for me. You know how when people are put into positions of tremendous stress, and start reflecting about why they are even in that position in the first place? Well, that was me during a large part of the previous semester...

Which brings me to thinking about how one could avoid being caught up in such craziness in the future, and what are some good ways to avoid it

1. Goal setting
2. Empathy for other people's problems.
3. Finding and enforcing a balance - reduce being crushed by the panic monster
