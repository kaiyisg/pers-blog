I am blogging to chronicle my life experiences and thoughts on it. But more than that, I am also blogging to be able to engage in different subject matters with different people, and to engage on issues outside of my comfort zone, stuff that I see on a daily basis. 

An experimental (and good) habit, I hope I would be able to keep this habit up even as i go on my journey...
