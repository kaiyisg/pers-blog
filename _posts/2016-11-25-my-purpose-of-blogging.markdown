As I start on my 1 year journey in the bay area, I would like to start blogging as a means of self-expression and self-reflection. After reading through other people's blogs, I believe that blogging can benefit me in 3 main ways:

1. Sharing ideas and passions
I am also blogging to be able to engage in different subject matters with different people, and to engage on issues outside of my comfort zone

Build writing skills

Reflect and think deeply
Apart from being able to chronicle my life experiences and thoughts on it. But more than that

An experimental (and good) habit, I hope I would be able to keep this habit up even as i go on my journey...
