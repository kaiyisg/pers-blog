I have recently run into a situation where I had to deal with the question of what makes good engineering practices, how important they are in a company in the face of limited resources, and what is the compromise that an engineering leader should make in the face of the question of "pushing features vs solidifying engineering". I think this is a pertinent question to ask in all organizations, but most appreciably, in startups which have limited time, money, and resources.

So, before going any deeper, what do I think are good engineering practices?
- Continuous integration with testing
- Peer code reviews
- Scrum meetings

Of course, a startup can never match up to a big company in terms of implementing these features.

However, it is my opinion that in a startup, no matter how big or small, these practices are crucial to building the engineering culture, team, and professionalism of each individual inside the team, to let engineers take pride in their work, to retain engineering talent, and is crucial overall to the sustainablity of the company.
